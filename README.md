# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
VBA script was written to analyze 2017 and 2018 stock data for 12 tickers to determine which stocks had the best returns over the course of a year. The original code performed calculations for each ticker individually and then printed the results in a worksheet before moving on to the next ticker. Due to the length of time it took to run the code, it was refactored to store the data in arrays and then print all of the values at the end of the script.
